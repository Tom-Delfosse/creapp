      <h5 class="title title--smaller">What is a gopher?</h5>
    <p>The Gopher is a small burrowing rodent native to North and Central America. They spend most of their lifetime digging their burrows and living in&nbsp;them.</p>
    <h5 class="title title--smaller">What does a gopher look&nbsp;like</h5>
    <p>Usually, gophers are around 6 to 8 inches in body length.
      They have sharp, predominant teeth which allow them to dig without having dirt coming in their mouth, along with 5 claws that help them bore through gardens and&nbsp;farmlands. 
    </p>
      <p>Gophers also have big pouches on each cheek, which they use to store food and necessities, which is why they’re called “pocket gophers”. Their fur is commonly brown to grey-ish, that matches the color of the soil they live&nbsp;in.</p>

    <section class="section section--lifestyle">
      <h5 class="title title--smaller">Lifestyle of a&nbsp;gopher</h5>
      <p>Gophers essentially live underground and dig deep and sinuous tunnels that expand tremendously and can reach up to 
        2,000 square&nbsp;feet.</p>

        <!-- img -->

        <p>They spend most of their lifetime in their burrows, and they also store food and other materials they need to survive through colder seasons, as they don’t&nbsp;hibernate.</p>
        <p>Gophers are herbivores and  even though they can eat stems and leaves of plants they find nearby, they prefer roots and other things one can find underneath the ground. They may destroy crops, but also ventilate the ground and stuff it with nutrients that help crops&nbsp;grow.</p>

      <ol class="list list--lifecycle">
        <li class="list__el">
          <h6 class="title title--smallest">Birth & early&nbsp;days</h6>
          <p>At birth, gophers are usually weak and blind and stick to their progenitor for around one month. Once that time has elapsed, newborn gophers are rejected from the burrow and have to survive on 
            their&nbsp;own.</p>
          </li>
        <li class="list__el">
          <h6 class="title title--smallest">40 days later&#8239;:&#8239;end of the weaning&nbsp;period</h6>
          <p>Once out of their “burrow of birth”, gophers have to dig their own tunnels which can take up to 2,000 square feet, which is around the size of a common suburban&nbsp;house.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list__el">
          <h6 class="title title--smallest">12 months later : sexual maturity</h6>
          <p>1 year after they are born, gophers reach their sexual maturity, which means they can now reproduce. But the amount of baby gophers one female gopher can have depends on the humidity of the soil the live in : in more arid areas, gophers may only have one litter, which is around 6 baby&nbsp;gophers.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="list__el">
          <h6 class="title title--smallest">End of&nbsp;life</h6>
          <p>Gophers have a rather short lifespan : they can live around 1 to 3 years, regardless of predators such as hawks, snakes and weasels or other fatal diseases they may come across throughout their lives. Some gopher species, however, can live up to 5 &nbsp;years.</p>
